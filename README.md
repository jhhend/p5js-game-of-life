# p5js-game-of-life
A small interactive example of Conway's Game of Life. The user can run the simulation or step through one iteration at a time.

There are 3 color themes:
* Normal: A standard white/black color scheme
* Heatmap: Live cells change their color based on how many live cells are in their neighborhood
* Survive: Live cells are white by default, but are green if they are slated to live on to the next iteration
